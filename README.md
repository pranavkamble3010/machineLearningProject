### Introduction

We are working on the empirical data gathered and made available by the Tanzanian Government as a result of a nationwide survey of water pumps and their natural sources. The goal of this project is to predict the status of the water pumps based on various data points gathered in the survey. By examining the data, the status can be functional, non-functional, or functional but needs repair.

The primary objective of the problem statement is to identify the water pumps that need attention can be given the priority to service them to ensure that there is enough water availability across Tanzania

 

With the enormous capabilities that the field of machine learning provides, the possibilities that this field works with are limitless. It is of utmost importance to know how to best make use of the techniques that suit you the most. With this project, we aim to get an idea of working through the entire machine learning pipeline and try various supervised machine learning techniques. 

 

This project is our effort to learn machine learning techniques right from analyzing the data to running a few machine learning algorithms to better get a good understanding of the concepts.
